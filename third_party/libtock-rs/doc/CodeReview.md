Code Review
===========

## Code Review Practices

PR to `libtock-rs` can be divided into two categories:

1. **Upkeep pull requests** are minor changes to existing functionality.
   Examples include bug fixes (that do not significantly affect APIs) and
   documentation that describes an existing implementation.
1. **Significant pull requests** are pull requests that are too substantial to
   be considered upkeep pull requests. Significant pull requests may include new
   functionality, API changes, significant refactoring, new tooling, and other
   changes.

The owners of `libtock-rs` (listed [below](#owners)) determine whether a PR is
an upkeep PR or a significant PR. PRs should be merged by the `libtock-rs`
owners rather than the PR's author. In general, PRs should be merged using a
`bors r+` command rather than the GitHub UI (see the [bors
documentation](https://bors.tech/documentation/) for more information on bors).

A PR may only be merged when all of the following are true:

1. At least one `libtock-rs` owner (who is not the PR author) has approved the PR.
1. All outstanding review discussions have been resolved.
1. If the pull request is significant, a 7 day waiting period has passed since
   the PR was opened.

We recommend that authors of significant PRs comment on the PR when they believe
the above criteria have been satisfied (including the waiting period). This is
primarily to remind the owners to merge the PR. Secondarily, it should help
identify confusion about a PR review's status.

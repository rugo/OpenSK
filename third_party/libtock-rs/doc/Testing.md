Testing
=======

Note: This describes the test infrastructure for the Tock 2.0 `libtock-rs`
crates, not the Tock 1.0 crates. Not all of the Tock 2.0 crates have been merged
into this repository yet.

This document gives an introduction to the tests in this repository, and is
intended to be useful to `libtock-rs` contributors.

## Unit Tests

Cargo packages in this repository that are platform-independent (i.e. that do
not depend on `libtock_runtime`) have unit tests that use Rust's builtin test
harness. These unit tests run on a fully-featured host OS (Linux, Mac OS,
Windows, etc...) and therefore do not depend on a real Tock kernel. Instead,
these unit tests use the fake kernel provided by `libtock_unittest`. As a
result, most `libtock-rs` crates have `libtock_unittest` in their
`[dev-dependencies]`.

`libtock_platform` is a bit of an exception to this rule. If all of
`libtock_platform`'s unit tests were in `libtock_platform`, the following would
occur:

1. `cargo` builds `libtock_platform` with `cfg(test)` enabled to make the test
   binary.
2. `cargo` builds `libtock_unittest` because it is a `[dev-dependency]` of
   `libtock_platform`
3. `cargo` builds `libtock_platform` without `cfg(test)` because it is a
   dependency of `libtock_unittest`

Both copies of `libtock_platform` end up in the final binary. These contain
incompatible instances of the `Syscalls` trait, resulting in hard-to-understand
errors.

To solve this, some of `libtock_platform`'s unit tests (namely, those that
require `libtock_unittest`) were moved to a `platform_test` crate.

## Integration Tests

`libtock-rs`'s integration tests are Tock process binaries that can run on an
emulated or real Tock system. They live in `libtock`'s `tests/` directory.

TODO: Figure out a test runner strategy for automatically running all the
integration tests, and document it here.

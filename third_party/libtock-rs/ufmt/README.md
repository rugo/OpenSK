# Tock fork of `ufmt`

**This is a fork of the [ufmt](https://github.com/japaric/ufmt) crate.** We are
currently evaluating whether `libtock-rs` should use `ufmt` for its debug
formatting functionality. Because `ufmt` has unfixed bugs (and appears to be
unmaintained), we have forked it here and are making bugfixes.

This fork is temporary and will be removed when one of the following happens:

1. We decide that `ufmt` is the right solution for `libtock-rs`. If this
   happens, we will work to restore the maintenance of `ufmt`.
2. We decide that `ufmt` is not the right solution for `libtock-rs`, at which
   point we will replace it with an alternative.

We did the following to create this fork:

1. `wget 'https://github.com/japaric/ufmt/archive/fe817a3cd5d1a3f4edaf8828193519069f2901ec.zip'`
1. `unzip fe817a3cd5d1a3f4edaf8828193519069f2901ec.zip`
1. `mv ufmt-fe817a3cd5d1a3f4edaf8828193519069f2901ec ufmt`
1. Changed the wording of the License section of `libtock-rs`' `README.md` to
   mention that `ufmt` has its own license.
1. cd `ufmt`
1. Removed CI infrastructure and tools that aren't used now that this is in a
   subdirectory of `libtock-rs`:
   `rm -r cg.png ci .github .gitignore nopanic .travis.yml`
1. Committed, creating commit
   [5163051a2d7fefbe4c9b1c6ba62b79fa07c324e7](https://github.com/tock/libtock-rs/commit/5163051a2d7fefbe4c9b1c6ba62b79fa07c324e7).

Further changes beyond the commit mentioned above are in separate commits so
their diffs are readable.

# `Î¼fmt`

> A (6-40x) smaller, (2-9x) faster and panic-free alternative to `core::fmt`

![Call graph of formatting structs](cg.png)

Call graph of a program that formats some structs (generated using
[`cargo-call-stack`]). Source code can be found at the bottom of this file. The
program was compiled with `-C opt-level=z`.

[`cargo-call-stack`]: https://crates.io/crates/cargo-call-stack

## [API docs](https://docs.rs/ufmt)

## Design goals

From highest priority to lowest priority

- Optimized for binary size and speed (rather than for compilation time)

- No dynamic dispatch in generated code

- No panicking branches in generated code, when optimized

- No recursion where possible

## Features

- `Debug` and `Display`-like traits

- `core::write!`-like macro

- A generic `Formatter<'_, impl uWrite>` instead of a single `core::Formatter`;
  the `uWrite` trait has an associated error type so each writer can choose its
  error type. For example, the implementation for `std::String` uses
  `Infallible` as its error type.

- `core::fmt::Formatter::debug_struct`-like API

- `#[derive(uDebug)]`

- Pretty formatting (`{:#?}`) for `uDebug`

# Minimum Supported Rust Version (MSRV)

This crate is guaranteed to compile on stable Rust 1.34 and up. It *might*
compile on older versions but that may change in any new patch release.

### Formatting structs (snippet)

Full source code in [nopanic/examples/struct.rs](nopanic/examples/struct.rs).

``` rust
// ..

#[derive(Clone, Copy, uDebug)]
struct Pair {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}

static X: AtomicI32 = AtomicI32::new(0);
static Y: AtomicI32 = AtomicI32::new(0);

#[exception]
fn PendSV() {
    let x = X.load(Ordering::Relaxed);
    let y = Y.load(Ordering::Relaxed);

    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:?}", Braces {}).unwrap();
    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:#?}", Braces {}).unwrap();

    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:?}", Parens()).unwrap();
    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:#?}", Parens()).unwrap();

    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:?}", I32(x)).unwrap();
    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:#?}", I32(x)).unwrap();

    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:?}", Tuple(x, y)).unwrap();
    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:#?}", Tuple(x, y)).unwrap();

    let pair = Pair { x, y };
    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:?}", pair).unwrap();
    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:#?}", pair).unwrap();

    let first = pair;
    let second = pair;
    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:?}", Nested { first, second }).unwrap();
    uwrite!(&mut W, "{:#?}", Nested { first, second }).unwrap();
}

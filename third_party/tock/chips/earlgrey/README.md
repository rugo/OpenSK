EarlGrey Configurations
-----------------------

Since the EarlGrey chip has not yet been fabricated in silicon, using it
requires running it on an FPGA or in a simulator. These environments have slight
differences, and require slightly different configurations of the EarlGrey chip.
These configurations can be found in `chip_config.rs`.

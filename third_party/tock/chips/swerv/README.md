SweRV SoC Peripherals
=====================

The Western Digital SweRV Core EH1 is a 32-bit, 2-way superscalar, 9 stage
pipeline core. The SweRV Core EH2 was built off of the EH1, but adds dual
threaded capability for additional performance. Lastly the SweRV Core EL2 is
a smaller core with moderate performance. It was designed to replace state
machines and other logic functions in SoCs.

The SweRV Cores will be used in a variety of Western Digital products in the
near future. All three cores have been open sourced in CHIPS Alliance github.
CHIPS Alliance is an organization that develops open source hardware and open
source software design tools. It is a barrier free, collaborative environment
which lowers the cost of RTL development. The SweRV Core EH1 is available
at https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-SweRV

The EH2 is here, https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-SweRV-EH2

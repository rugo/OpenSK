LiteX SoCs with an integrated VexRiscv CPU
==========================================

LiteX is a Migen based Core / SoC builder. It allows developers to
combine peripherals and CPUs into a custom SoC easily. One of the
supported CPUs is the VexRiscv processor described in SpinalHDL.

This crate defines the `Chip` and support files for LiteX SoCs built
around a VexRiscv softcore CPU.

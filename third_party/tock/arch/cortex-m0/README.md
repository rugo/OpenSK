Cortex-M0 Architecture
======================

This crate includes legacy support for the Cortex-M0 architecture. We include
this in the Tock repo in case a future board (or out-of-tree board) wants to use
the Cortex-M0 architecture. However, Cortex-M0-based chips tend to be very
limited, and we have found them to largely not be well suited to support Tock.

Note: This crate may be out-of-date since it is largely not maintained currently
(as of December 2020).

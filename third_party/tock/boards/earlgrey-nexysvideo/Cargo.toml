[features]
# OpenTitan SoC design can be synthesized or compiled for different targets. A
# target can be a specific FPGA board, an ASIC technology, or a simulation tool.
# Please see: https://docs.opentitan.org/doc/ug/getting_started/ for further
# information.
#
# OpenTitan CPU and possibly other components must be configured appropriately
# for a specific target:
#    - fpga_nexysvideo:
#      OpenTitan SoC design running on Nexys Video Artix-7 FPGA.
#
#    - sim_verilator:
#      OpenTitan SoC design simulated in Verilator.

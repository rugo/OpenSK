//! Provides userspace with access to proximity sensors.
//!
//! Userspace Interface
//! -------------------
//!
//! ### `subscribe` System Call
//!
//! The `subscribe` system call supports the single `subscribe_number` zero,
//! which is used to provide a callback that will return back the result of
//! a proximity reading.
//! The `subscribe`call return codes indicate the following:
//!
//! * `SUCCESS`: the callback been successfully been configured.
//! * `ENOSUPPORT`: Invalid allow_num.
//!
//!
//! ### `command` System Call
//!
//! The `command` system call support one argument `cmd` which is used to specify the specific
//! operation, currently the following cmd's are supported:
//!
//! * `0`: check whether the driver exist
//! * `1`: read proximity
//! * `2`: read proximity on interrupt
//!
//!
//! The possible return from the 'command' system call indicates the following:
//!
//! * `SUCCESS`:    The operation has been successful.
//! * `EBUSY`:      The driver is busy.
//! * `ENOSUPPORT`: Invalid `cmd`.
//!
//! Usage
//! -----
//!
//! You need a device that provides the `hil::sensors::ProximityDriver` trait.
//! Here is an example of how to set up a proximity sensor with the apds9960 IC
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use kernel::static_init;
//!
//!let grant_cap = create_capability!(capabilities::MemoryAllocationCapability);
//!
//!let proximity = static_init!(
//!   capsules::proximity::ProximitySensor<'static>,
//!   capsules::proximity::ProximitySensor::new(apds9960 , board_kernel.create_grant(&grant_cap)));
//!
//!kernel::hil::sensors::ProximityDriver::set_client(apds9960, proximity);
//! ```

//! Low level interface for Key-Value (KV) Stores
//!
//! The KV store implementation in Tock has three levels, described below.
//!
//! 1 - Hardware Level:
//! This level is the interface that writes a buffer to the hardware. This will
//! generally be writing to flash, although in theory it would be possible to
//! write to other mediums.
//!
//! An example of the HIL used here is the Tock Flash HIL.
//!
//! 2 - KV System Level:
//! This level can be thought of like a file system. It is responsible for
//! taking save/load operations and generating a buffer to pass to level 1
//! This level is also in charge of generating hashes and checksums.
//!
//! This level allows generating a key hash but otherwise operates on
//! hashed keys. This level is not responsible for permission checks.
//!
//! This file describes the HIL for this level.
//!
//! 3 - KV Store:
//! This is a user friendly high level HIL. This HIL is used inside the kernel
//! and exposed to applications to allow KV operations. The API from this level
//! should be high level, for example set/get/delete on unhashed keys.
//! This level is in charge of enforcing permissions. It is expected that
//! this level will combine the user data with a header and pass that to the
//! level 2 system HIL.
//!
//! This level is also in charge of generating the key hash by calling into
//! level 2.
//!
//! There is currently no implementation of this HIL in Tock.
//!
//! The expected setup inside Tock will look like this:
//! +-----------------------+
//! |                       |
//! |  Capsule using K-V    |
//! |                       |
